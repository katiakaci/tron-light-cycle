# Tron Light Cycle game

## Overview
This project is a two-player game where each player controls a motorcycle and must navigate it to avoid colliding with the walls, the trail of the other player, or their own trail. The motorcycles speed up as the game progresses, making it increasingly challenging.

## Gameplay
Use the arrow keys (player 1) or W/A/S/D keys (player 2) to control the direction of your motorcycle.
Alternatively, click and drag the mouse to change the motorcycle's direction.
Players can pause, restart, and switch control between mouse and keyboard inputs during the game. You can choose who has command of the mouse by clicking the corresponding player button (player 1 or 2). When you have control, you can still use the keyboard keys to maneuver your motorcycle.

## Code Structure
The game's code is structured as follows:
Initialization of the game grid and variables.
Event handlers for keyboard and mouse input.
Functions to handle game logic, including collision detection, player movements, and game speed adjustments.
UI functions for pausing, restarting, and changing control methods.

## Technologies Used
HTML5 canvas for rendering the game graphics.
JavaScript for game logic and user interactions.
CSS for styling and enhancing the user interface.

## Future Improvements

Here are some planned improvements and features that will be added to the game in future updates:

1. **Sound Effects Integration:**
   - Fix bug related to the start of the background music: Due to autoplay restrictions in mainstream browsers (see [Chrome's autoplay policy](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay)), the background music doesn't start automatically when the page is loaded. Users are required to click on the page to initiate playback.
   - Add sound effects for movements such as left and right turns.

2. **Enhanced Graphics and Visual Effects:**
   - Add a toggle switch to the mouse control button to choose between Player 1 and Player 2 for mouse control.
   - Improve the appearance of the motorcycle trail.

3. **Customizable Game Settings:**
   - Provide options for customizing game settings such as control schemes, game speed/difficulty levels,  grid size, visual themes and other gameplay parameters.

4. **Mobile Compatibility:**
   - Optimize the game for mobile devices and ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.
   - Implement touch controls and gestures for intuitive gameplay on touch-enabled devices.

5. **Single-Player Mode:**
   - Create a single-player mode with challenging levels and objectives.
   - Develop an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels for single-player mode.
