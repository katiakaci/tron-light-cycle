# Tron Light Cycle game

# Overview
This project is a two-player game where each player controls a motorcycle and must navigate it to avoid colliding with the walls, the trail of the other player, or their own trail. The motorcycles speed up as the game progresses, making it increasingly challenging.

# Gameplay
Use the arrow keys (player 1) or W/A/S/D keys (player 2) to control the direction of your motorcycle.
Alternatively, click and drag the mouse to change the motorcycle's direction.
Players can pause, restart, and switch control between mouse and keyboard inputs during the game. You can choose who has command of the mouse by clicking the corresponding player button (player 1 or 2). When you have control, you can still use the keyboard keys to maneuver your motorcycle.

# Code Structure
The game's code is structured as follows:
Initialization of the game grid and variables.
Event handlers for keyboard and mouse input.
Functions to handle game logic, including collision detection, player movements, and game speed adjustments.
UI functions for pausing, restarting, and changing control methods.

# Technologies Used
HTML5 canvas for rendering the game graphics.
JavaScript for game logic and user interactions.
CSS for styling and enhancing the user interface.

# Credits
This game was created by Katia Kaci as a fun project to demonstrate programming and game development skills.
